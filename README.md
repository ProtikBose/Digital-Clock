# Digital-Clock

This is an iGraphics assignment. Here I have made a digital clock using iGraphics.h by applying geometry and co-ordinates knowledge. As a [Fall Out Boy](https://www.google.com/search?q=fall+out+boy&oq=Fall+out+&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l2j69i60j0.4199j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) fan I have also added a song(Centuries) playing in the background of the video!

iGraphics details can be found from iDoc.pdf and UserGuide.pdf files.

iGraphics.h header file contains some drawing functions that can be used to draw basic graphical shapes in Visual C++. These functions are implemented in openGL. Users of iGraphics do not need any knowledge of openGL to use it. Simply calling the drawing functions a user can draw any 2D shape on screen. This library also provides easy ways for animation, keyboard and mouse event handling.
